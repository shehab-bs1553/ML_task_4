The task involves two main sections:
1.Computer Vision Section:
   * Basic image processing operations using OpenCV.
   * Operations include grayscale conversion, resizing, edge detection, histogram equalization, and thresholding.
   * Selected images are saved in the Selected_Image_folder for performing the above task on the images.
   * Processed images are saved in the cv_output directory.
   
2.Audio Processing Section:
  * Fundamental audio processing techniques using a chosen audio processing library.
  * Operations include waveform plotting, spectrogram computation, and feature extraction (MFCC, chroma features, spectral contrast, zero-crossing rate, and spectral roll-off).
  * Selected audios are saved in the Selected_audio_file for performing the above task on the audio file.
  * Plots are saved as images in the audio_plots directory
  * Features are saved in the audio_features.csv CSV file.
